    "The notion of using entropy as a measure of change in system state and dynamics comes both from [statistical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy) and from [information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)). In statistical physics, entropy is a measure of disorder and uncertainty in a random variable; the higher the entropy, the greater the disorder. In the statistical physics context, the term usually refers to [Gibbs entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(statistical_thermodynamics)), which measures the macroscopic state of the system as defined by a distribution of atoms and molecules in a thermodynamic system. Gibbs entropy is a measure of the disorder in the arrangements of its particles. As the position of a particle becomes less predictable, the entropy increases. For a classical system (i.e., a collection of classical particles) with a discrete set of microstates, if $E_i$ is the energy of microstate $i$, and $p_i$ is the probability that it occurs during the system's fluctuations, then the entropy of the system is\n",

    "\n",
    "In information theory, entropy is also a measure of the uncertainty in a random variable. In this context, however, the term usually refers to the [Shannon entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)), which quantifies the expected value of the information contained in a message (or the expected value of the information of the probability distribution). The concept was introduced by [Claude E. Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon) in his 1948 paper \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication.\" Shannon entropy establishes the limits to possible data compression and channel capacity.  That is, the entropy gives a lower bound for the efficiency of an encoding scheme (in other words, a lower bound on the possible compression of a data stream). Typically this is expressed in the number of ‘bits’ or ‘nats’ that are required to encode a given message. Given the probability of each of n events, the information required to predict an event is the distribution’s entropy. \n",

    "\n",
    "The Shannon entropy is by far the most common information-theoretic measure there are others. Other information-theoretic measures include: plog,Rényi entropy, Hartley entropy, collision entropy, min-entropy, Kullback-Leibler divergence and the information dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Shannon entropy is the Rényi entropy with an alpha of one (see appendix). The Shannon entropy is a simple estimate of the expected value of the information contained in a message. It assumes independence and identically distributed random variables, which is a simplification when applied to word counts. In this sense it is analogous to naïve Bayes, in that it is very commonly used and thought to work well in spite of violating some assumptions upon which it is based.\n",

The Renyi entropy ordering is related to the underlying probability distributions and allows more probable events to be weighted more heavily. As alpha approaches zero, the Rényi entropy increasingly weighs all possible events more equally, regardless of their probabilities. A higher alpha (a) weighs more probable events more heavily.

    "[Random forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks, that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. Random decision forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set. \n",
    "\n",
    "The training algorithm for random forests applies the general technique of bootstrap aggregating, or bagging, to tree learners. Given a training set $X = x_1, ..., x_n$ with responses $Y = y_1, ..., y_n$, bagging repeatedly (B times) selects a random sample with replacement of the training set and fits trees to these samples:\n",
    "\n",
    "For $b = 1, ..., B$:   \n",
    "\n",
    "*  Sample, with replacement, B training examples from $X, Y$; call these $X_b, Y_b$.   \n",
    "*  Train a decision or regression tree $f_b on X_b, Y_b$.  \n",
    "*  After training, predictions for unseen samples $x'$ can be made by averaging the predictions from all the individual regression trees on $x'$:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{f} = \\frac{1}{B} \\sum_{b=1}^Bf_b (x')\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "or by taking the majority vote in the case of decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "This bootstrapping procedure leads to better model performance because it decreases the variance of the model, without increasing the bias. This means that while the predictions of a single tree are highly sensitive to noise in its training set, the average of many trees is not, as long as the trees are not correlated. Simply training many trees on a single training set would give strongly correlated trees (or even the same tree many times, if the training algorithm is deterministic); bootstrap sampling is a way of de-correlating the trees by showing them different training sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of samples/trees, $B$, is a free parameter. Typically, a few hundred to several thousand trees are used, depending on the size and nature of the training set. An optimal number of trees $B$ can be found using cross-validation, or by observing the out-of-bag error: the mean prediction error on each training sample $x_i$, using only the trees that did not have $x_i$ in their bootstrap sample. The training and test error tend to level off after some number of trees have been fit.\n"
