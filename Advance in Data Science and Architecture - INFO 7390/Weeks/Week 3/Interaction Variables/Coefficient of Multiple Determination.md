# Coefficient of Multiple Determination

Coefficient of Multiple Determination
The coefficient of multiple determination (R2) measures the proportion of variation in the dependent variable that can be predicted from the set of independent variables in a multiple regression equation. When the regression equation fits the data well, R2 will be large (i.e., close to 1); and vice versa.

The coefficient of multiple correlation can be defined in terms of sums of squares:

where SSR is the sum of squares due to regression, SSTO is the total sum of squares, ŷ is the predicted value of the dependent variable, y is the dependent variable mean, and y is the dependent variable raw score.
