## Overview

**Communication for Engineers** is an exciting new initiative that MGEN leadership, in conjunction with Global Student Success, has been developing over the past year. It's aim is to equip graduate engineering students with the skills, knowledge, and confidence to communicate in professional contexts within the US workplace, specifically by focusing on listening comprehension and spoken articulation to prepare students for both on site and virtual job interviews.

Nominees of the Spring 2020 **Communication for Engineers** cohort are invited to **please review the attached PDF and read through the email below**.

## How will this help me?

* Just like ENCP 6000, this “Communication for Engineers” course will meet once a week
* Each week will focus on a different aspect of English usage in the workplace
* Some weeks will focus on the mechanics of English language (such as sounds, rhythm, intonation)
