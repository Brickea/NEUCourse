## Four important thought in object-oriented

### Abstraction

Abstraction means the idea or concept of something which is completely **separate** from any specific instance.

### Polymorphism

There are many form of polymorphism

#### Dynamic polymorphism (run-time)

Uses the same interface for methods on different types of objects

They have **same input** and same output, but they do have **different processing**, which is called **overriding**

#### Static polymorphism (compile-time)

Implements multiple methods with the **same name**, but **different parameters**, which is called ***Overloading*

### Inheritance

Inheritance is base a new object or class on an existing one.

Inherit the existing attributes and methods

Greate form of code reuse

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is about containing the elements of an object and protect them

## Analysis design, and programming

```Analysis``` - Understand your problem

```Design``` - Plan your solution

```Programming``` - Build it

### Typical five-step approach

1. Gather requirements
2. Describe the application
3. Identify the main objects
4. Describe the interactions
5. create a class diagram

## Unified Modeling Language(UML)

Standardized notation for diagrams to visualize object-oriented systems.
