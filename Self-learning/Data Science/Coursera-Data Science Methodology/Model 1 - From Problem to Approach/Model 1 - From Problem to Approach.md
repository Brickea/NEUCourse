## What is the goal

First question is to ask the person who give you the problem - **What is his goal**

For example, if a business owner asks: 

"How can we reduce the costs of performing an activity?" 

We need to understand, is the goal to improve the efficiency of the activity? Or is it to increase the businesses profitability?
