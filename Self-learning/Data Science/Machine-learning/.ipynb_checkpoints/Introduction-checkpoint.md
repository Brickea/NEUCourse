# Introduction for Machine Learning

## Major machine learning techniques

* Regression/Estimation
    * Predciting continuous values
    * Ordinal regression
    * Poisson regression
    * Fast forest quantile regression
    * Linear, Polynomial, Lasso, Stepwise, Ridge regression
    * Bayesian linear regression
    * Decision forest regression
    * Boosted decision tree regression
    * KNN (K-nearest neighbors)
* Classification
    * Predicting the item class/category of a case
* Clustering
    * Finding the structure of data; summarization
* Associations
    * Associating frequent co-occurring items/events
    
* Anomaly detection
    * Discovering abnormal and unusual cases
* Sequence mining
    * Predicting next events; Click-stream(Markov Model, HMM)
* Dimension Reduction
    * Reducing the size of data(PCA)
* Recommendation systems
    * Recommending items
