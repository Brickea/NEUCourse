# Day 1

## 1. Statistics in Data Preparation

Statistical methods are required in the preparation of train and test data for your machine learning model.

This includes techniques for:
* Outlier detection.
* Missing value imputation.
* Data sampling.
* Data scaling.
* Variable encoding.
* And much more.

A basic understanding of data distributions, descriptive statistics, and data visualization is required to help you identify the methods to choose when performing these tasks.

## 2. Statistics in Model Evaluation

Statistical methods are required when evaluating the skill of a machine learning model on data not seen during training.

This includes techniques for:
* Data sampling.
* Data resampling.
* Experimental design.
* Resampling techniques such as k-fold cross-validation are often well understood by machine learning practitioners, but the rationale for why this method is required is not.

## 3. Statistics in Model Selection

Statistical methods are required when selecting a final model or model configuration to use for a predictive modeling problem.

These include techniques for:
* Checking for a significant difference between results.
* Quantifying the size of the difference between results.

This might include the use of statistical hypothesis tests.​

## 4. Statistics in Model Presentation

Statistical methods are required when presenting the skill of a final model to stakeholders.

This includes techniques for:
* Summarizing the expected skill of the model on average.
* Quantifying the expected variability of the skill of the model in practice.
* This might include estimation statistics such as confidence intervals.​

## 5. Statistics in Prediction

Statistical methods are required when making a prediction with a finalized model on new data.

This includes techniques for:
* Quantifying the expected variability for the prediction.
* This might include estimation statistics such as prediction intervals.​

## Your Task

For this lesson, you must list 3 reasons why you personally want to learn statistics.

I would love to see what you discover.

In the next lesson, you will discover a concise definition of statistics.
