# Final Project

## Data science Displayed on a Dashboard

Extracting essential data from a data set and displaying it is a necessary part of data science; therefore, individuals can make correct decisions based on data. Understanding analytics, trends, and happenings through displayed data is the purpose of a dashboard.

## Dashboard Analytics Displayed

A dashboard often provides a view of key performance indicators. Analyzing a data set and extracting key performance indicators will be practiced. Prompts will be used to support learning in accessing and displaying authentic data in dashboards. Learning how to display key performance indicators on a dashboard will be included in this assignment.

## Watson Studio

You also have the option to store the Dashboard on IBM object storage so anyone can view the Dashboard; however, you will not be marked on this aspect. The next sections will set you up with IBM object storage. You will need Watson Studio to share your results. You will be creating a project with Watson Studio. If you have already signed up for Watson Studio, you will still have to get the notebook link at the end of the section.

## Introduction

Extracting essential data from a dataset and displaying it is a necessary part of data science; therefore individuals can make correct decisions based on the data.
