## Personal Statement

My name is WangZixiao and I am an Information System student. I have been more than 4 years' professional studying in software engineering. 

While  I was at the lab of a professor, I studied the production process of float glass and determined to control the temperature stability by using Long Short-Term Memory, which is kind of machine learning method. And with a team, we improved the yield of glass about 2%.So I think I have strong skills in programming learning and communicating with people. 

Besides, When I was a sophomore, I was leading a educational support team. And many public welfare activities were held by us. So I think I am really good at programming, researching and communicating. 

Can you tell me about Northeastern University graduate programs?
