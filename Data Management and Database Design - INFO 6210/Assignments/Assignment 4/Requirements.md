Each student will prepare a briefing presentation, make and post a VDO recording of their presentation online, email the instructor the link to the online VDO post (VDO recording should capture slide and the presenter face and voice)

1. Provide 5 examples of the normalization process from pre-normalization through 1NF, 2NF, 3NF and BCNF and the explanation with what happens with the functional dependencies as the transition takes place (Include table diagrams as needed to demonstrate the process flow); You may create your own example and the associated data fields. Be sure to explain how each data field is related to one another in terms of functional dependencies (Note: I will select examples from the class input and use them in the midterm exam)
1. Create 8 Q/As on Normalization topic  (Note: I will select examples from the class input and use them in the midterm exam)

Slides submission to individual folder on dropbox:  1/28 @6pm (No late submission will be accepted)


There is no limit to the page count on the slides as long as the slides contain good logical flow and  meaningful contents. 

## Team Requirement:

Prepare/Ready one team member or up to the whole team to present at the beginning of Week 4 class.  

Up to two teams will be selected to present and received extra credit for the presentation.   The selection of which team to present will be based on the quality of the slides.

The presentation time is flexible based on content and discussion.

 

The teams that do not get to present may steal the extra credit points from the team that is doing the presentation through asking valid questions. Points are earned through the following methods:

Extra points to the presenting team: if they can answer the question from the audience on Normalization topic (All questions must be withing scope) successfully

Extra points to the questioning team if the presenting team cannot answer the question successfully

Each questioning team will get an opportunity to ask at least one question and up to two questions max. 



I will grade both the presentation slides and VDO presentation.

Top three students will get another extra credit (5 points to the total Midterm Scores; not percentage)
