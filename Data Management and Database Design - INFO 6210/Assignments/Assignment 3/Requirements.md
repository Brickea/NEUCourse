Assignment #3: Team Project Proposal (Due 1/23/20 @6pm via Dropbox's Team folder)

## Team Requirement:

1. Submit both your written project proposal in MS Word (.doc/,docx) and proposal presentation in the Powerpoint (.ppt/.pptx) format to your team dropbox due NLT January 23th, 2020 @ 6pm.

**Important note**: Late submissions will receive zero points for this assignment.

See a file in the shared folder (NFO6210.20.SP.Resources/Proposal.Example/), it describes a minimum set of things that you must include in your proposal and the required "Use Restriction" watermark.

You **must include the "Use Restriction" watermark** in final report, proposal and any other WORD format submittal; watermark template is provided below

Submittal without the required watermark will result in points (5% of the total assignment grade) reduction from total assignment scores.

In the case of PPT format, you must include the following text below at the footer on all the slides (Font size: 8-10)

**"Use Restriction: INFO6210 Spring 2020, Use of this material outside this class required approval by Instructor Chaiyaporn Mutsalklisana Â© 2020 and properly referencing the original authors/team -- (Material and Content include portions and/or whole report/presentation in the form of hard copy & digital media)"**

(As a suggestion, the page number of the proposal based on the contents required should be at least 8++ pages, if correctly put together.  There is no page limit as long as you can convey your idea and intent clearly)
