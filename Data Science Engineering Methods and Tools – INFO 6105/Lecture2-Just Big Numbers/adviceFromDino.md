## Advice

Some students asked me for pointers for good books. I don't read programming books, they put me to sleep. Instead, i've indicated some good youtube videos below.

But you know what, you don't need them. You already have one of the best guides in introductory data science. Not only at NU, or only in the USA. So, take advantage of him, and spend the rest of your time with dragons and magic, sports, or clubbing, instead ðŸ˜‰ Spend most of your time on your class python notebooks. By the end of the class, you'll be a good python programmer, good enough for most jobs out there.

We covered a lot of material today and I encourage you to rerun every single cell and understand what is going on. In the last section, I moved code around to get you familiar with thinking of code as Lego blocks that you assemble together. And there are different ways of putting things together, and some ways may be better for others, but the one you pick is good for you and that's good enough for me (as long as you get the correct solution ðŸ™‚!

Turtle is a neat drawing package, but don't try it if you don't already have programming experience, because you'll crash often.

The genetic programming hw is similar to your R hw. Do what we did, but for different data. It's going to be challenging, but you will learn a lot. And we only have one weekend to learn basic python before we move on. There is so much more to learn, this semester!

Why did I introduce genetic programming (GP) today? Because it teaches you about searching intelligently for solutions in the space of all possible solutions. Which is what you want to do when you try to build a model for data. How to find the best model? It's also how Darwinian evolution works (solutions with better fitness than others are more attractive and so tend to be picked more for sexual mating, which leads to even fitter descendents), so if it's pretty good for life on earth, it's also pretty good for computer problems. Also, a lot of machine learning algorithms use GP to optimize hyperparameters in their algorithms, so it's good to know.
