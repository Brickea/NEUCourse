    "**Ribonucleic acid** (RNA, along with **DNA** and **proteins**, is one of the three major biological macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life on our planet. A central tenet of molecular biology states that the flow of genetic information in a cell is from DNA through RNA to proteins: “DNA makes RNA makes protein”. \n",
    "\n",
    "Proteins are the workhorses of the cell; they play leading roles in the cell as enzymes, as structural components, and in cell signaling, to name just a few. \n",
    "\n",
    "DNA(deoxyribonucleic acid) is considered the “blueprint” of the cell; it carries all of the genetic information required for the cell to grow, to take in nutrients, and to propagate. \n",
    "\n",
    "RNA–in this role–is the “DNA photocopy” of the cell. When the cell needs to produce a certain protein, it activates the protein’s gene–the portion of DNA that codes for that protein–and produces multiple copies of that piece of DNA in the form of **messenger RNA**, or mRNA. \n",
    "\n",
    "The multiple copies of mRNA are then used to translate the genetic code into protein through the action of the cell’s protein manufacturing machinery, the **ribosomes**. Thus, RNA expands the quantity of a given protein that can be made at one time from one given gene, and it provides an important control point for regulating when and how much protein gets made.\n",
    "\n",
    "For many years RNA was believed to have only three major roles in the cell–as a DNA photocopy (mRNA), as a coupler between the genetic code and the protein building blocks (tRNA), and as a structural component of ribosomes (rRNA). In recent years, however, we have begun to realize that the roles adopted by RNA are much broader and much more interesting. We now know that RNA can also act as enzymes (called ribozymes) to speed chemical reactions. In a number of clinically important viruses RNA, rather than DNA, carries the viral genetic information. \n",
    "\n",
    "RNA also plays an important role in regulating cellular processes–from cell division, differentiation and growth to cell aging and death. Defects in certain RNAs or the regulation of RNAs have been implicated in a number of important human diseases, including heart disease, some cancers, stroke and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of this machinery of life is how it uses smaller building blocks (DNA, RNA) to build bigger building blocks (proteins). Computer Science posesses this beauty, too. **Iteration** and **recursion** are key Computer Science techniques used in creating algorithms and developing software.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, an iterative function is one that loops to repeat some part of the code, and a recursive function is one that calls itself again within itself, in order to repeat the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using a simple **for loop** to display list contents is an **iterative process**. Examples of simple recursive processes aren't easy to find, but solving the Tower of Hanoi are common examples."

    "\n",
    "Lindenmayer began by imagining a single one-dimensional line of cells, with any individual cell\n",

What it does is it takes one of the numbers in the list, $x$ and sums it to the rest by calling itself with a slightly smaller list than initially: the list minus the number $x$. Eventually, when the number of elements in the list reduces to 1, the recursive function ends the recursion by returning that last number.\n",
