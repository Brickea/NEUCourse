    "Linear algebra is the study of *linear transformations* on **vectors**, which represent points in a finite dimensional space. The matrix-vector product $y = A x$ is a linear combination of the columns of $A$.  The familiar definition,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y_i = \\sum_j A_{i,j} x_j $$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ y_1 = A_{1,1} x_1 + \\cdots + A_{1,n} x_n \\\\\n",
    "   y_2 = A_{2,1} x_1 + \\cdots + A_{2,n} x_n \\\\\n",

    "   y_n = A_{n,1} x_1 + \\cdots + A_{n,n} x_n $$\n",

    "= \\Bigg[ A_{:,0} \\Bigg] x_0 + \\Bigg[ A_{:,1} \\Bigg] x_1 + \\dotsb . $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The notation $A_{i,j}$ corresponds to the Python syntax `A[i,j]` and the colon `:` means the entire range (row or column).  So $A_{:,j}$ is the $j$th column, and $A_{i,:}$ is the $i$th row.  The corresponding Python syntax is `A[:,j]` and `A[i,:]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an elementary example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "v = 3*x - 2*y\n",
    "w = 5*x + y\n",
    "```\n",
    "Given $v = 3$ and $w = 1$, what are $x$ and $y$?\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to solve 2 linear equations of 2 unknowns. We already did this with MOM. Solve the first equation for x (as a function of y). Then plug x into the second equation. Get the solution for y. Then plug in the value of y in the first equation. Get x. Simple!\n",
    "\n",
    "But there is a more mechanistic way of doing this, which works for 2 equations of 2 unknowns or 100 equations of 100 unknowns. And computers can do it reall well, too!\n",
    "\n",
    "A Matrix is a **spreadsheet**, and Matrix multiplication is **how you move in state space**. Remember, finding the solution to a problem is usually locating a global maximum (or minimum) in your state space that maximizes (or minimizes) a **cost function** (Metropolis' cost function is the probability of observing the data with the model at hand). \n",
    "\n",
    "The cost function is your ***mountain***, and you're climbing the mountain to try to get to its **peak**. At the peak, the derivative is zero, and the function is at its maximum. \n",
    "\n",
    "How do you **move** from one point on the mountainside to another point on the mountainside? You get your location (it's a **vector**), you multiply by a **matrix** (which is a vector transformation), and you get to another location (a different vector). Each step is a matrix multiplication. Since each step can be different, each matrix can be different.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Metropolis, we moved along a **single axis**, so that was simple: add a delta. But if you move in 2D, 3D, or nD space, you move by taking your current coordinates in that space, mutliplying by a matrix, and getting to new coordinates.\n",

    "* A vetor is like an arror pointing to a location on the mountain, right? Well, an **eigenvector** $v$ is a **position on the mountain** $x$ such that ***for a class of mountain moves described by a matrix $C$***, the resulting position (or vector) $y$ following that mountain move is **parallel** to the original position $x$ (some multiple of $x$). \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are eigenvalues?\n",
    "\n",
    "Given $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}$, $\\lambda$ is the **eigenvalue** of $C$ if there is a non-zero vector $x$, the corresponding **eigenvector**, such that the following is true:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Is there a move that can take a mountain-climber to *some factor* times his original position? If so, the old position is an eigenvector, and the moving factor is its eigenvalue.\n",

    "Formally, given a square matrix $C \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}$, we say that $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}$ is an **eigenvalue** of $C$ and $x \\in \\mathbb{C}^n$ is the corresponding **eigenvector**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, this definition means that multiplying $C$ by the vector $x$ results in a new vector that points in the same direction as $x$, but is scaled by a factor $\\lambda$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that for any **eigenvector** $x \\in \\mathbb{C}^n$ **of $C$**, and scalar $k \\in \\mathbb{C}, C(kx) = kCx = k\\lambda x = \\lambda(kx)$, so $kx$ is also an **eigenvector of $C$**. For this reason when we talk about **“the” eigenvector** associated with $\\lambda$, we usually assume that the **eigenvector** is normalized to have length $1$ (this still creates some ambiguity, since $x$ and $−x$ will both be **eigenvectors**, but we will have to live with this).\n",

    "\n",
    "A **Markov chain** is any *memorlyess* process that can be modeled with a *stochastic transition* matrix. It's like a mountain climber that always forgets her previous position, and only cares about the next (which is the right state of mind if you're climbing *El Capitan* in Yellowstone National Park! Did you see the movie *Free Solo*? Scariest movie of my life!)\n",

    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "### Repeated transitions\n",
    "Conjecture: If the transition matrix $P$ is the same after each step (time homogeneous), then the k-step transition probability is.. the k-th power of the transition matrix, $P^k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't think I need to convince you of this, we illustrated this with the mountain climber and the Combo matrix!\n",
    "\n",
    "And so, the k-step transition is characterized by the matrix $A^k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steady state limit\n",
    "Now what if, in the long term, after many powers of $k$, we suddenly transition to a condition where the states don't change very much? Well, we acheive what is called a **steady-state** condition: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$P^{\\;k+1} = P^{\\;k}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Stationary distributions are super-interesting to Wall Street, because they describe the ***future***! Suppose we call that future ***is*** the state vector $\\pi$. Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\pi = P . \\pi$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hey, wait a second, does that equation remind you of anything?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Eigenvectors and the *future*\n",
    "The eigenvectors $X_1, \\cdots X_n$ of $n$ x $n$ matrix $A$, and its associated eigenvalues $λ_i$, are such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A X_i = λ_i X_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And so the **future**, described as state vector $\\pi$, is the eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue 1!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Google** realized that this corresponds to the steady state condition of a sliver surfer surfing the Web through its hyperlinks. It descibes the probabilistic future state of the sliver surfer. If you rank all of its components from highest probability to lowest probability, it's the Google search page for your search query (corresponding to a silver surfer surfing for Web pages relevant to your query terms)!\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume the mountain climber climbs the entire mountain using just one type of jump, let's call this the **Twist** matrix jump.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that we are able to represent any position on the mountain as a **linear combination of eigenvectors** of the **Twist** matrix. That, in fact, is a ***theorem*** that is true if the **Twist** matrix is **non-singular** (has a non-zero **determinant**).\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the mountain climber's position after $n$ **Twist** jumps, we multiply her position vector by the **Twist** matrix, $n$ times, right? Which corresponds to a single multiplication by the matrix **Twist$^n$**, right? Each application of **Twist** adds a factor of the eigenvalue $λ$ to the coefficient of each eigenvector in the expansion of the state. Recall: The eigenvectors don’t transform much.. They just squish or expand (by a factor of $λ$). So after $n$ transitions, the coefficient of each eigenvector has gained a factor $λ^n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If λ > 1, this factor would grow without bound as $n$ increases, leading to matrix elements larger than 1, which would catapult the mountain climber to the moon! So, there must not be any eigenvalue strictly larger than one!\n",
    "\n",
    "If λ < 1, this factor would suppress the contribution of the corresponding eigenvector as $n$ increases. It’s fine if this happens to some eigenvectors, but if it happens to *all of them*, the probability interpretation of our state vector would also be ruined, because all entries in our vector would be driven to zero, and the mountain climber would **never move**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, **there must be at least one eigenvalue greater or equal to one!**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **dominant eigenvector** (eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue = 1) of any Markov chain *is* the **steady-state limit (the *long-term future*) of the Markov chain**!\n",
    "\n",
    "The dominant eigenvector will become the *only unsuppressed contribution* to the state vector as $n$ gets large.\n",
    "This eigenvector therefore represents the steady-state towards which every **linear system** tends to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dominant eigenvector is the future of Markov chains. That is why we love Markov chains: With a bot of math, wwe can predict their future!\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we start with a random vector (random mountain climber position), and apply the **Twist** matrix a million times, we will ultimately converge to the dominant eigenvector, since all other eigenvalue-to-the-power-a-million contributions will become suppressed. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's the same method used by Google to rank the WWW!\n"

    "Linear algebra in n-dimensional space is all about climbing a mountain in n dimensions, and each step can be represented by multiplying the position vector of the mountain climber by a step-matrix, to move to a new position represented by a new position vector. The position vector is just the arrow from the origin (start of the climb) to the current position of the climber. So as the mountain climber moves, that vector essentially rotates around its axis (the origin), and thus matrix multiplication is essentially a **solid rotation**. A matrix describes a specific kind of mountain move. For that mountain move, the matrice's eigenvectors describe all possible position vectors that are parallel before and after the move, while its eigenvalues describe by how much the climber has actually moved in that direction.\n",
