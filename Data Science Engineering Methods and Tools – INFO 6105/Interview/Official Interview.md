We're going to hold data science interviews next week friday from **6 to 9P, sections 1 and 4 combined**.

The TAs and I are going to hold interviews in parallel (two or three  interviews at the same time). You need to sign up for an interview in order to be able to attend the interview sessions. The idea is that by preparing for an interview and observing 2 or 3 interviews at a time, you will be better prepared for your own data science interview!

Students that already interviewed can come to watch and are exempt of signing up for another interview, albeit they are allowed to interview again.

We will be ranking interviews (ternary classification ðŸ˜‰), so that you can have an idea how you did.


## Friday 6 Dec, 6-9P, Behrakis 310.
You need to sign up on Rui's kanban board.
Happy thanksgiving!
