    "However, care should be taken to prevent one extremely fit solution from taking over the entire population in a few generations, as this leads to the solutions being close to one another in the solution space thereby leading to a loss of ***diversity***. Maintaining good diversity in the population is extremely crucial for the success of a GA. This taking up of the entire population by one extremely fit solution is known as ***premature convergence** and is an undesirable condition in a GA.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Fitness Proportionate Selection*** is one of the most popular ways of parent selection. In this every berkian can become a parent with a probability which is proportional to its fitness. Therefore, fitter berkians have a higher chance of mating and propagating their features to the next generation. Therefore, such a selection strategy applies a selection pressure to the more fit individuals in the population, evolving better individuals over time.\n",

    "Consider a circular wheel. The wheel is divided into $n$ pies, where $n$ is the number of berkians on planet Berk. Each berkian gets a portion of the circle which is proportional to its fitness value.\n",

The region of the wheel which comes in front of the fixed point is chosen as the parent. For the second parent, the same process is repeated.\n",
